 * A WORD OR A PROGRAM IN EVERY BRANCH of an `if` or a `match` that is bound:
 *
 *   _ <- if bad then Fail.raise[String]("no") else if odd then Writer.tell[String](n) else unit
 *
 * Such an expression has no one type to bind, and at run time a word does not say what it is. So it is taken apart
 * where it is written, by the second macro here: each branch is made a program of the row on its own (`Fits`), as if
 * the row had been expected of it. Nothing of it is left at run time.
